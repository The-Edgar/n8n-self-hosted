Read [README.md](mdc:README.md) to understand how our N8N self-hosted is set up.

When you need to run operations in our N8N docker instance, use `ssh hetzner '...'`, e.g. to get logs from the docker use `ssh hetzner 'cd /opt/n8n && docker compose logs n8n --tail 50'`.

Use context7 for official library and methods documentation.

When asked about creating, updating, editing or doing anything about N8N workflows, use contxt7 to find out the specifics of what nodes, operations and modules are available on N8N.
